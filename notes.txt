Challenges:

- how can I get input field data and use it with the Google API.? Created seperate variables in order  concatenate into a query string which would be the search result. I could then fetch data from search result.

- look into "escaping" & HTTP querystring to fill in the search term for the googlebooks api

- got a Googlebooks API key from Google cloud.



Future Features:
- add auto complete feature when user begins typing into input field.

- implement expand text on click. for books with larger descriptions

- implement AJAX to add "load more" feature at the bottom
